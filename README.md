# ID Photo Editor

This repository includes the code for a personal project towards ID photo editor.
The target for this tool is to allow me to properly crop out my head for ID photo.
Though there are many online / mobile apps for this purpose, I would like take the 
opportunity to write some code myself and learn to utilize machine learning algorithms 
to make ID photo cut to best quality.

The project includes
* A glfw / imgui based python front end.
* Segmentation methods (YOLO, etc.)
* Trimap generation and manual editing
* Image Matting (MattFormer, etc.)

There is no new algorithm developed in this project.
It's puting existing models / algorithms together to form a personal tool.
